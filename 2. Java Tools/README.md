# Java Tools

We must learn about JDK, JRE & JVM and the differences between them before we learn about the Java Language.

## Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

It provides the runtime environment in which the Java Bytecode is executed. JVMs are platform dependent as the steps needed to convert bytecode into machine code is dependent on the Operating System. It loads, verifies and then executes the code.

## Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

It is the set of tools which are used to implement the runtime environment for running Java applications. It contains the JVM, set of libraries and other components used by JVM at runtime.

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

It is a software development tool which is used to develop Java applications. It consists of JRE, the Java compiler (javac), the Java debugger, Java loader(java), Java documentation (javadoc) and an archiver(jar).

We use the JDK to make Java programs. However, to run them we only need the JRE. JVM, JRE & JDK are platform dependent, while the Java lanugage is platform independent.
