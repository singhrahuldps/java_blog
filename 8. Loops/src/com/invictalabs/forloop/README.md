# For Loop

This loop is used to execute a block of code a known set of time.

## Code Output

```bash
1 
1 2 
1 2 3 
1 2 3 4 
1 2 3 4 5 
```

## Syntax

```java
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
	statements;
}
```

This is used when we know the starting and ending conditions of the loop. Initialization is ran only once at the beginning of the loop and then the condition is checked. If found to be true, the following code block is executed. After that the increment/decrement operation is performed and then the condition is checked again. This task is repeated until the condition becomes false.
