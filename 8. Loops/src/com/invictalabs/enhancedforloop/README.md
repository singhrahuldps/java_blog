# Enhanced For Loop

This loop is a simpler variant of the classic for loop and it enables us to easily iterate over list elements.

## Code Output

```bash
Rahul
Virat
Sourav
```

## Syntax

```java
for(DataType var:list){
	doSomething(var);
}
```

We can traverse over a List elements easily through this enhanced for loop. The variable var refers to each element of list sequentially and allows us to perform the desired operations on them.
