# While Loop

It is used to execute a block of code repeatedly when we are not sure about how many iterations need to be done.

## Code Output

```bash
1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 
```

## Syntax

```java
while(condition){
	statements;
}
```

At the beginning of the loop, the condition is evaluated and if found to be true, the following code block is evaluated. This action is repeated while the condition remains true. The loop terminates when the condition becomes false.
