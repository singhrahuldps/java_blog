# Do-While Loop

This loop is used whenever we want the loop to be executed atleast once.

## Code Output

```bash
Enter first number: 
5
Enter second number: 
12
Sum is 17 
Press 1 to add more numbers, 0 to exit: 
0
```

## Syntax

```java
do{
	statements;
} while(condition);
```

The body of a do-while loop gets executed atleast one time and then the condition in while is checked. This block gets executed again if the expression in while is evaluated to be true and it keeps on repeating until the condition is false.
