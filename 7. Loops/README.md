# Loops in Java

Loops are generally used to execute a block of code multiple times. It helps to reduce the amount of written code required to run the logic and also allows us to repeat code when we don't know how many times it is to be repeated.

We introduce the four basic loops in Java i.e. For loop, Enhanced-For loop, While loop & Do-While loop.

Each of these loops have a different syntax and it is advised to use each for different use cases however any loop implementation could is possible using any of these loops. They could also be used interchangeably but it is not advised to do so.
